    <div><h3>WHY HOZIER?</h3>
    <h2>Why you should listen to Hozier:</h2>
    <p>Hozier's music offers something for everyone. With influences of soul, folk, gospel, and rock, there is a song or two for every possible mood.</p>
        <p>Hozier is well known for his song Take Me To Church, which is a song he wrote in protest to the violence being done against queer people in Russia. He has other songs in this tradition, like Jackboot Jump, about opression, and But The Wages, about the backsliding of so many things in our culture, and the need for workers to be fairly compensated.</p>
        <p>Hozier's music also shows a great passion for gender equality. He writes songs about powerful women, with complex personalities, who do not need he or anyone else to stand up for him. In Swan Upon Leda he champions the rights of women and people who give birth to their own bodies. His song Cherry Wine, about someone trying and failing to come to terms with their abusive relationship, is written from the perspective of a man being abused by a woman, though the video shows a woman being abused by a man.</p>
        <p>But there is a dark undercurrent to Hozier's music that I personally respond to. His heroines are often dark and scary, he writes about lust, and deceit, violence, and drugs. His songs about these things have inspired a lot of my own writing and dancing. Hozier has the power to both uplift and cry of the horrors of the world, often in the same song. His guitar skill is unmatched and his work with his music director Alex Ryan is well arranged and beautiful to the ear, even when the lyrics of a particular song don't land for an individual.</p>
